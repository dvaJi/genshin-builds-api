[{"id":"basalt_pillar","name":"Basalt Pillar","description":"It is a testament to Geo's status as the heaviest of the elements. Maybe the reason a Geo Hypostasis creates this pillar out of its shell and raises itself is just to get closer to the sky, not to combat enemies.","source":["Dropped by Lv.30+ Geo Hypostases"],"rarity":4},{"id":"cleansing_heart","name":"Cleansing Heart","description":"Though it has already diffused among the depths of the lake, its purity remains all the same. But why would a creature so pure and clean as an oceanid covet the appearance of a being that roams the land, and assume such a form with pure water? They need not breathe nor do they require sustenance...","source":["Dropped by Lv. 30+ Oceanids"],"rarity":4},{"id":"crystalline_bloom","name":"Crystalline Bloom","description":"These frosty crystals will continue to grow according to their own cold, rigid laws, till one day a flower of winter shall bloom and freeze everything. Perhaps it is stagnant time, that never-thawing bosom, that is the essence of this undying flower.","source":["Dropped by Lv.30+ Cryo Hypostases"],"rarity":4},{"id":"dew_of_repudiation","name":"Dew of Repudiation","description":"It has strong rejection properties, and this forms the basis of one of the Hydro Hypostasis' attack patterns as well. They say that water contains memories and willpower, and that these things can grow when bodies of water meld together. However, the waves conjured by the Hydro Hypostasis are incompatible with the currents that flow above and below ground. Even if it were to flow into the surpassingly pure waters of Petrichor, this drop of water will likely resist assimilation as strongly as mercury.","source":["Dropped by Lv. 30+ Hydro Hypostases"],"rarity":4},{"id":"everflame_seed","name":"Everflame Seed","description":"Endless desires flow among turbulent energy deep within the earth. What desire could steadily hold such fire to the plants and long so eagerly to bathe everything in unquenchable flames?","source":["Dropped by Lv. 30+ Pyro Regisvines"],"rarity":4},{"id":"hoarfrost_core","name":"Hoarfrost Core","description":"Energy and thoughts that swell deep within the earth will eventually erupt on the surface. Even the deathly silent frost will attach to living things on the ground, turning even ordinary vegetation like vines into huge, vicious predators.","source":["Dropped by Lv. 30+ Cryo Regisvines"],"rarity":4},{"id":"hurricane_seed","name":"Hurricane Seed","description":"Contains the essence of Anemo energy.<br/>It is said that the power to create hurricanes resides within its seemingly fragile body. This butterfly of pure Anemo energy must surely be waiting for the day when it can conjure up storms once again.","source":["Dropped by Lv. 30+ Anemo Hypostases"],"rarity":4},{"id":"juvenile_jade","name":"Juvenile Jade","description":"These dull crystals are precipitated within the bodies of vishaps sleeping in the mountains. Liyue folklore holds that they will gather power over many years, after which this crystal will, at last, replace their original heart, and the vishap will become a true dragon â€” one that can shake the mountains and split the earth.","source":["Dropped by Lv. 30+ primo geovishaps"],"rarity":4},{"id":"lightning_prism","name":"Lightning Prism","description":"An ordinary prism separates white light into its component colors; a Lightning Prism, however, channels flowing energies and weaves them into lightning. It will continue to do so even after the Electro Hypostasis has been defeated.","source":["Dropped by Lv. 30+ Electro Hypostases"],"rarity":4},{"id":"marionette_core","name":"Marionette Core","description":"Flesh decays, and with it decay all martial arts mastery and all poignant memories.<br/>Perhaps only by converting one's four limbs and body into sturdy mechanical parts, and by at last sacrificing one's very own heart for a sophisticated mechanical one, can one transcend the impermanence of the fleshly form...","source":["Dropped by Lv. 30+ Maguu Kenki"],"rarity":4},{"id":"perpetual_heart","name":"Perpetual Heart","description":"Some theorize that the symbols on these cores have knowledge and logic inscribed upon them in a language that eyes cannot perceive. Some go a step further and believe that these unique Ruin machines autonomously decided to forsake a biomimetic form to pursue strength of function on account of their especially large cores and complex inscriptions.","source":["Dropped by Lv. 30+ Perpetual Mechanical Arrays"],"rarity":4},{"id":"smoldering_pearl","name":"Smoldering Pearl","description":"Even the burning flames shall one day grow cold, and even the ashen firewood can will itself back into a raging blaze. It must then be the will of the world that Pyro Hypostases should constantly cool down and heat up, much like the universe teems with endless life... until the fated darkness shall one day descend and bring it all to naught.","source":["Dropped by Lv.30+ Pyro Hypostases"],"rarity":4},{"id":"storm_beads","name":"Storm Beads","description":"It is said that Thunder Manifestations will only descend upon lands where powerful hatred dwells. The singers say that it is the unbearable disappointments and sufferings of life that drive them to forever wander the broken earth, unleashing sky-searing lightning as they go.","source":["Dropped by Lv. 30+ Thunder Manifestations"],"rarity":4}]
