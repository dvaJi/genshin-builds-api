If you leave the Ideal Tension Zone, the acceleration will reset.<br/>A special fishing rod created for the sake of the Lunar Leviathan. To tackle this legendary fish, the creator of this rod specially added some material with rare functions onto the rod itself and the fishing line, giving it both great malleability and tensile strength. Of course, such a treasure could easily catch ordinary fish, but that seems like overkill to the point where even the rod might feel ashamed to be used thus.","type":"Fishing Rod","rarity":4,"source":["Obtained From Event"]},{"id":"narukawa_ukai","name":"Narukawa Ukai","description":"If you can stay within the Ideal Tension Zone while fishing, this rod will shorten the time in which fish will struggle by a stable amount and increase your chances of success. This effect only works in Inazuma.<br/>A rod created to commemorate the ancient Ukai, or Cormorant, fishing method. The ruby-red gem at the tip of the rod represents the tinder used by the cormorant fishers, and the bird ornaments along the rod's shaft represent the cormorants themselves, who helped the hard-working Inazumans pass through those cataclysmic years. This low-efficiency fishing method has long become obsolete, but the persevering, pioneering spirit has been passed down together with this rod.","type":"Fishing Rod","rarity":4,"source":["Exchange at the Inazuma Fishing Association"]},{"id":"wilderness_rod","name":"Wilderness Rod","description":"A rather pedestrian-looking wooden fishing rod. Apart from being quite sturdy, even to point where you could use it for self-defense, it lacks any sort of special features. But the old adage holds true â€” \"the novice's rod shall be the tent-pole of their veterancy.\" Even the greatest of anglers must surely have started with this simple implement.","type":"Fishing Rod","rarity":4,"source":["Obtain from quests"]},{"id":"windtangler","name":"Windtangler","description":"If you can stay within the Ideal Tension Zone while fishing, this rod will shorten the time in which fish will struggle by a stable amount and increase your chances of success. This effect only works in Mondstadt.<br/><br/>A long, bright, transparent rod created by a poet from Mondstadt. To help borrow the power of Anemo to help raise the rod, the poet rather ingeniously designed a fishing reel made from the leaves of Windwheel Asters, which also imparts a certain romanticism of \"lingering in the wind\" to this device. But perhaps there were issues in the handiwork or in the design itself, for the finalized product could not spin as freely as expected. Perhaps this is what they call \"the chasm between professions?\"","type":"Fishing Rod","rarity":4,"source":["Exchange at the Mondstadt Fishing Association"]},{"id":"wishmaker","name":"Wishmaker","description":"If you can stay within the Ideal Tension Zone while fishing, this rod will shorten the time in which fish will struggle by a stable amount and increase your chances of success. This effect only works in Liyue.<br/>A long rod that stands like elegant bamboo. It is said to have been constructed and kept by a skilled hermit from Liyue, and it was first discovered on a stone tablet with the following words carved upon it: \"O you who aspire, take up this rod,\" like a legendary sword waiting for a hero to pull it out. Of course, you only ever hear this glorious origin story from the mouths of merchants, so it may just be some rhetoric used to increase the item's value... But those who know this and still use this rod can only be those who are ready and willing to accept this pact.","type":"Fishing Rod","rarity":4,"source":["Exchange at the Liyue Fishing Association"]}]
