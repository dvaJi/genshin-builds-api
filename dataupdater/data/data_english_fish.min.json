At present, it can only be found near water bodies around the abodes of the adepti. Its pale white lines are very striking, and it has greater longevity than other members of the species and is thus regarded to be a lucky fish blessed by the adepti.<br/>Most people from Liyue will refuse to eat this fish on principle, given the common respect for the adepti, but some fear no such superstition and claim that eating these fish can help one extend one's years.","type":"Fish","rarity":3,"source":["Obtained from fishing"],"bait":{"id":"false_worm_bait","name":"False Worm Bait","rarity":2}},{"id":"aizen_medaka","name":"Aizen Medaka","description":"A lively, energetic fish famous for its flowery patterns.<br/>Long ago, there was a funny story that said that you could get Aizen Medaka by throwing normal Medaka into a pot of blue dye. This was most likely born from a child's over-active imagination, but has nonetheless given rise to not a few unscrupulous fish hawkers. This in turn has given rise to some conversations that go something like \"Hey, is it just me, or is the blue on your fish washing off?\" In response, the Ministry of Civil Affairs specifically posted this notice: \"The market is a wet and wild place.

Its fiery-red coloration seems to have much to do with Pyro, for while they cannot quite become flame generators, they do have some control over high temperatures. They can convert energy from their food and focus it on their dangerous snouts, making them underwater scoundrels indeed.<br/>\"Need to drill wood to make a flame?

They are especially prickly during courtships, where even the slightest breeze or smallest ripple might trip their fuse.

As the name suggests, this creature spreads bitterness wherever it goes in the underwater world. Its water cannon projectiles are slower and smaller than those of its ordinary counterparts, but the power of such attacks is undiminished due to the incredibly bitter pheromones within. During their courtship phase, an observer might bear witness to the curious sight of males and females of this species blasting each other with these water cannons. Perhaps passing on the bitterness of life is also a manifestation of love.","type":"Fish","rarity":3,"source":["Obtained from fishing"],"bait":{"id":"fake_fly_bait","name":"Fake Fly Bait","rarity":2}},{"id":"brown_shirakodai","name":"Brown Shirakodai","description":"A gentle, elegant butterflyfish variant.

This has made these fish very sought after by people from all walks of life and caused their market value to soar. However, this is just amusing to the fishermen, who know the inside story: That object is merely a Loach Pearl that the fish ate by mistake. It rolled into the fish's salty intestines, only to spat back out of the mouths of merchants with an agenda.

In truth, its bloodline and behavior could not be more different from that of a dragon — it can neither call forth the wind and rain nor the power of domination and is actually often the victim of food-snatching due to its weak character. A real shame, of course, that it looks so very majestic.

Other than its gills, it can also breathe through its vestigial scales, which is a feature much more similar to that of amphibians.

However, few people know that this rather silly exterior hides a killer technique — this fish is capable of sucking water into its body before expelling it like a cannon from its mouth with such force and pinpoint accuracy that even fishermen might be stunned by it.

Very strong-willed, it will fight any interloper that dares to steal its food or enter its territory.
